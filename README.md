# Dojo F# Web API Example Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Dojo F# Web API Example Project! This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of building a Web API using F#. Participants will explore the key concepts, features, and best practices for developing robust APIs with F#.

## Session Goals

In this dojo, we will cover:

- Setting up an F# Web API project
- Implementing RESTful API endpoints
- Handling requests and responses
- Integrating with SQLite for data storage
- Implementing Authentication & Authorization
- Documenting the API with OpenAPI

## Prerequisites

To fully benefit from this session, participants should have a basic understanding of:

- F# programming language
- Web API concepts and RESTful services
- Basic knowledge of .NET and ASP.NET Core
